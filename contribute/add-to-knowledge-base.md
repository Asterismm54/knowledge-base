# Contribute to Knowledge Base

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this knowledge base. You may either add a new topic or page or enhance an existing one. Please make sure that your contributions follow the ethical guidelines expected by Carleton University. Content that is inappropriate will not be published.&#x20;

There are two ways you can publish edits to this website.

### Edit on Gitbook

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) is the documentation tool that we are using for this knowledge base. Gitbook gives you a really nice editing interface. To use GitBook to edit the Knowledge Base, follow these steps:

* If you don't already have one, create an account on [https://www.gitbook.com/](https://www.gitbook.com) using your Carleton University email address, and you should have access to the SCESoc organization.
* Click on the Knowledge Base space and click the edit button on the top right
* Find and edit the page you want to make changes to or create a new page
* Once you are done making changes, at the bottom, add a subject and click the "Submit for Review" button. A SCESoc representative will review your changes and suggest any required changes before merging them.

### Edit on GitHub

The data for this repository is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com). This means that you can also use GitHub to make changes. Some may prefer this if they are comfortable with Git. Here are the steps to make a change using GitHub.

* You can either click the "Edit on GitHub" link on the right side of each page to directly go to the exact file. Or you can go to this repository ([https://github.com/SCESoc/knowledge-base](https://github.com/SCESoc/knowledge-base)) and find the file you want to edit. Each page is a file, and each section and page with a subpage is a folder. You can create a new folder or file if neccessary.
* In order to be able to edit the repository, you will have to fork the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request to the parent repository. Here is a guide from GitHub that walks you through this workflow ([https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)).
* Once you submit a pull request, a SCESoc representative will review your changes and suggest any required changes before merging them.
