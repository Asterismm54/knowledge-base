# 🏗 Building Your First Project

Have you ever worked on a personal or side project before? If so, have you ever stuck with a project long enough to label it "completed"?

Working on a project comes with a lot of challenges, but that's what makes it such a rewarding process. If you're thinking of working on your first project, it can be overwhelming. If you're someone that is thinking of starting your first project or having trouble making decent progress on a before you drop it, this guide is for you.

Each project is unique, and there are countless different types of projects one can work on. Hence, in this guide, we will use examples of building a physical house. Though this guide is geared towards computer and programming projects, we are going to use this example to keep things more general. Hopefully this way there is less bias towards a certain type of project in the computer world and keep a more general approach to tackling projects that could work for a wider variety of projects.

### Step 1: Coming up with an idea

The first step is to have an idea of what you want to build. Ideally, you have an idea that you are excited to work on and something that takes you closer to your goals. If you have no idea what to work on, here are some tips you can use to land on your idea.

* **Look for inspiration in other people's work**: Seeing other peoples work can give you an idea of what is possible. Then use this inspiration to make your own version of the project.
* **Consider what you want to learn**: Think of the different skills you want to attain and work on projects that would expose you to those skills.
* **Dream small**: Bigger projects take a lot more effort and time which can lead to demotivation to work on those projects. Start off with small projects and use the momentum you build from the smaller projects to work on bigger ones later.

### Step 2: Breaking it down

Once you have an idea for your project, you need to understand what it consists of to be able to start working on it. If you don't know what you're building, you are showing up to a battle with no weapons.

Building a house can feel like an impossible project if you haven't done it before. But if you break it down into smaller projects, things start to feel easier. Building a house can be broken down into the following:

* Create a blueprint
* Buy the equipment and materials
* Start building
  * Set the foundation
  * Build floor 1
    * Put up walls
    * Add electrical wiring
    * Drywall
    * Furnish rooms
  * Build floor 2
    * ..... etc.

Breaking things down does two things:

1. It gives you a better understanding of what the project entails and all the steps you would have to do to get to the final product.
2. It gives you more but smaller and more achievable steps towards building a project. It might be hard to find a step by step guide to building your house the way you want it, but when you break it down into smaller steps like adding drywall or adding electrical wiring, it's easier to find information about those steps ultimately getting you closer to your goal.

### Step 3: Identify the core components

Once you've broken things down into smaller components, you need to identify which of these steps are the core of the project. There might be a million things you can do to make a project great, but the initial goal should be to get the important part of the project working rather than worrying about all the fancy features we can add to it.&#x20;

While building a house, it's important to have walls, a roof and basic utilities. But worrying about the colour of the walls in the living room before building the walls will only slow you down. So, build the walls and worry about the paint later.&#x20;

### Step 4: Create a plan for A-B, not A-Z

Once you've identified the core components that you need to tackle in your project, create a plan on how you would go about it. Create a plan on how you will get from A-to-B and not A-to-Z. This means that your plan should help you accomplish your first iteration of the project and not necessarily the very final product. It's hard to plan that far ahead with any level of accuracy. So plan for the short term and revisit your plan often to updated as the project goes on.

One helpful strategy is to come up with an [MVP - Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum\_viable\_product). An MVP is basically the simplest version of the project you can make that accomplishes the core functionality with no extra or fancy features. Coming up with an MVP will help you focus on the core components of the project. The MVP should basically be the first version of your project. Your project can always be iterated and improved upon, that is one of the perks of computer and programming projects.

### Step 5: Start coding and get stuck

Once you have a plan, you just gotta start moving. Don't stick to Steps 1-4 for too long. Planning can seem very productive, but it can also be a great tool for procrastination. It's never the right time to start something. You just got to start coding.&#x20;

You will get stuck, and that's okay. It wouldn't be a worthwhile project if you don't run into obstacles as you wouldn't be learning as much. And things don't need to be perfect as you're working on it, you can always come back to make something better than it is. Just focus on getting things to work in the most simple way possible and keep the momentum.

### Step 6: Push through and stay consistent

One of the hardest but most effective things in life and in building projects is consistency. Through the course of the project, there will be moments that you might not be as motivated or things seem impossible, but you just gotta push through and stay consistent. Find creative ways to solve problems and show up every day. It's like a video game, the more you play, the better your character is. With every day that you show up and do the work, you level up. These level-ups might not be noticeable day after day, but when you look at your progress after a few weeks or months, it will surprise you. There is no such thing as an overnight success, people only tend to notice the day you became successful and not the years you spent working to get there.

If you can, find people to collaborate with and hold you accountable. It's something that can really help you to push through those tough times.

### Step 7: Share your progress

You can either sit in your cave building your masterpiece in the darkness to potentially find out that your project doesn't help or resonate with people the way you thought it would, or you can build it in public constantly getting feedback from people to make the end product better than it is.

Sharing your progress has many benefits:

* You get feedback from the community that can greatly save you time and effort by knowing what people like. For example, if you're working on a portfolio, getting feedback from recruiters can help you build a more tailored portfolio.
* You can ask for help when stuck. There are a lot of people that are willing to help.
* More visibility for your project. Building in public can help with getting more eyes on your project.&#x20;
* You can document your progress to help other people that may be on a similar path.

### Step 8: Iterate

Once you find after steps 1-7 that you've been able to create an MVP version of your project, celebrate that win and start iterating on a newer and more improved version. Now that you have the most simple and core functionality of your project working, you can start worrying about the next core set of components, and if resources provide, some fancy features as well. This can be a constant loop to make the project better in each iteration. Keep doing this until you are satisfied with where your project is at.
