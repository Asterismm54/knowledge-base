# For Professors

Professors are a huge resource of knowledge and support for the students. We would love for professors to also contribute their intellectual knowledge to this repository.

Some ideas for the types of content professors can contribute are:

* Public practice problems for courses
* Extra resources for courses
* Information about research work you might be performing
* Other resources on topics you maybe be passionate about
* Enhancing existing information
