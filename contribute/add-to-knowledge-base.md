There are two ways you can publish edits to this website.

### Edit on Gitbook - Recommended

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) is the documentation tool that we are using for this knowledge base. Gitbook gives you a really nice editing interface. To use GitBook to edit the Knowledge Base, follow these steps:

* Click on the following invite link to be added to the SCESoc organization on GitBook - [https://app.gitbook.com/invite/mbbUiN9NFX7eyGOzuvIt/fEDzk6xw6haYP9fHu0Za](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/mbbUiN9NFX7eyGOzuvIt/fEDzk6xw6haYP9fHu0Za). If you don't already have an account with [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), create one **using your Carleton University email address**.
* Optional - Once you sign in with your Carleton University email, you can go to your account settings and connect your account to [GitHub](https://github.com). Content on this webpage is synced with a GitHub repository. Connecting your GitHub account will mark the commits as authored by you, hence displaying your contributions to the GitHub World.
* Click on the Knowledge Base space and click the edit button on the top right.
* Find and edit the page you want to make changes to or create a new page. Make your changes.
* Once you are done making changes, at the bottom, add a subject and click the "Submit for Review" button. A SCESoc representative will review your changes and suggest any required changes before merging them.

### Edit on GitHub

The data for this repository is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com). This means that you can also use GitHub to make changes. Some may prefer this if they are comfortable with Git. Here are the steps to make a change using GitHub.

* You can either click the "Edit on GitHub" link on the right side of each page to directly go to the exact file. Or you can go to this repository ([https://github.com/SCESoc/knowledge-base](https://github.com/SCESoc/knowledge-base)) and find the file you want to edit. Each page is a file, and each section and page with a subpage is a folder. You can create a new folder or file if necessary.
* In order to be able to edit the repository, you will have to fork the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request to the parent repository. Here is a guide from GitHub that walks you through this workflow ([https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)).
* Once you submit a pull request, a SCESoc representative will review your changes and suggest any required changes before merging them.
