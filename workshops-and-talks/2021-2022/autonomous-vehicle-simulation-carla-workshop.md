# ðŸš— Autonomous Vehicle Simulation (Carla) Workshop

![Autonomous Vehicle Simulation (Carla) Workshop Banner](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Ever wonder what happens when you introduce a bug in the software of a self-driving car? Does thousands of dollars worth of equipment, work and time go down the drain? Well, thanks to software such as Carla, you can train and test your models in a safe and simulated environment. Carla is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. It helps you research, build and test your software in a simulated environment making programming autonomous vehicles more accessible, safe and powerful.
