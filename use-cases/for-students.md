# For Students

This platform is primarily for students to share knowledge with each other. Take full advantage of the platform by browsing information that exists on here.

The more students that share their unique perspectives and experiences, the more beneficial this platform would be. Hence, we highly encourage you to contribute and extend this knowledge base.&#x20;

Some ideas for kind of resources you can contribute are:

* Information about a new technology you learned about
* Coding challenges
* Project ideas and resources
* Resources from a workshop/talk you hosted
