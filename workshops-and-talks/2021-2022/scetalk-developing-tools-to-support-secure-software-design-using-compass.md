# SCETalk - Developing Tools to Support Secure Software Design using Compass

![](../../.gitbook/assets/SCETalk\_secure\_software\_1.png)

System architects, developers, and evaluators need simple and intuitive tools to help them design secure software systems. While a number of secure system design tools exist, it is hard for system architects and other stakeholders to keep up with the availability and improvement of these tools over time. This problem is compounded as more secure system design tools are released. To tackle these challenges, we developed Compass, a web-based toolkit to house secure system design tools. The goal with Compass is to create a one-stop-shop for secure system design tools to help system architects and other stakeholders keep up with the different tools and techniques to design secure systems. In this talk, we will discuss the need for developing adequate tools to support system architects and designers in developing secure software systems. We will introduce Compass and discuss its design and underlying technologies. Lastly, we will demonstrate several tools that have been developed for Compass and explain how students, researchers, and developers can create tools that are intuitive and effective along with how they can contribute with 4th year projects, undergraduate and graduate research, and more.
