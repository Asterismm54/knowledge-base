The Knowledge Base is an effort by [SCESoc](https://www.scesoc.ca), the Systems and Computer Engineering Society in Carleton University. It is a repository of knowledge made by and for the peers at Carleton University.

Every year, several talented students with various experiences and knowledge get through the Systems and Computer Engineering Programs. This platform will act as a hub of knowledge for students to mutually share their learnings. This can include:

* Wikis on different topics/technologies
* Tutorials
* Challenges
* and more...
